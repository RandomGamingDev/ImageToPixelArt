# ImageToPixelArt
This application helps to turn a regular image into pixel art by allowing you to lower its resolution and limit its colors. However, please realise that this isn't going to compare to an actual artist, although it can help aid artists in their endeavours.

Simply answer the prompts (if you enter smth wrong it'll log it in console, but won't display it anywhere else so if the program stops working just refresh the page). So save the image just right click on the canvas and save the image by pressing the save image option.
